        <p>What's in there? I mean in life. What truly is there, that keeps every single person

          <h3>In General</h3>
          <p>I don't think I have any skills. Or not any good ones at least. I consider myself a procrastinator. Well, I do act like one and I know about it,
              but I do nothing, as a perfect procrastinator would. <br />
              Yet sometimes, when I do come out of my 'antisocial-lazy-useless' fantasy and I do absolutely anything that I find normal
              or even downright stupid and useless, the people around seem to be satisfied with my "work". And then they consider me a genius, as once I did myself.
              I found out, that some things, which I find particularly easy are a struggle for the others. I don't know why. Maybe I am the genius, the "smartass" that
              everyone sees me as. But I'm not so sure anymore. About anything at all.

          <h3>Overthinking</h3>
          <p>It's not a skill, but nowadays it's hard to find a person that thinks at all. Everyone's just on their phones, tablets, computers, or anything really, just so they don't have to face the real world. Yes, some do think outside their phones and then use that to
              "control" the people that don't think at all. I'm not saying that I'm not being fooled by these everyday technological humorous "pleasures", but
              I do at least think about how stupid I am when surfing the internet'n'stuff.

        <p>As you could've guessed from my statement above, I'm anti-social, so don't bother me if you don't have to. You'll make my day just by not interacting with me at all. So, cheers.</p>
